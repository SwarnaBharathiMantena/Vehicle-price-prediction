# Used vehicle price prediction on Craigslist dataset

The goal of the project is to predict the price of a used vehicle on craigslist. The dataset that I worked on can be found using this url: https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data

The main tasks that I concentrated on include: 
1. Identifying the relevant features for prediction 
2. Preprocessing the dataset and building a Baseline model 
3. In-depth preprocessing, Data cleaning, and Feature Engineering 
4. Predict using - Linear SVR, Decision Trees, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressorr, and XGBoost Regressor 
5. Feature Selection 
6. Develope an explainable model that performs well
